# php-react
Just me quickly brainstorming a few ways to get data from PHP to a React app without a full on API. 

## Local Install

Make sure you have NPM, Node and Webpack installed globally on your machine.

* Set a php server to serve the root dir
* navigate to desired demo and run
  ** npm install
  ** webpack -w
  
# Should be good to go!
